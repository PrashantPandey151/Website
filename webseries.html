                        <br />the CBI are  close on heals to catch the serial killer but with a

                        <h3>A criminal mastermind who goes by "The Professor" has a plan
                            <br /> to pull off the biggest heist in recorded history -- to print billions
                            <br /> of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To help him carry out the
                            <br /> ambitious plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities and
                            <br /> who have nothing to lose. The group of thieves take hostages to 
                            <br />aid in their negotiations with the authorities, who strategize to 
                            <br /> come up with a way to capture The Professor. As more time
                            <br />elapses, the robbers prepare for a showdown with the police.</h3>
